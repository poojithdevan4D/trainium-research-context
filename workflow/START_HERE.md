# Start here: running the autonomous workflow with Codex

## One-time setup (≈30 min, human)
1. Copy `workflow/` into the research repo root, and copy `workflow/AGENTS.md` to `AGENTS.md` at the repo
   root.
2. Create `research/v2/`. Seed `research/v2/queue.json` from `reports/2026-09-24-queue-v2.json`, and
   create an empty `research/v2/ledger.jsonl` and `research/v2/state.json`.
3. On the controller workstation, run `pip install torch pyarrow numpy` (CPU is fine) for the G2 preflight.
   Point G2 at the **real** `prepare.py` (default: the directory of `train.py`). `--stub-prepare` is only for
   machines without it.
4. Give only the Operator session SSH access to trn21 and trn22 (per-user keys, not the shared PEM). Every
   other session has repo access only.
5. Decide the alert channel (email, Slack or phone) and put its command in `research/v2/state.json`
   (`alert_cmd`). Never commit a secret. Reference an environment variable instead.

## Sessions (start each as a separate Codex task in the repo; paste the prompt)
| Session | Prompt |
|---|---|
| **sup** | "You are the Supervisor. Follow AGENTS.md and workflow/roles/supervisor.md. Run the cycle continuously; keep trn21 and trn22 busy; never override decide.py; alert me on AGENTS §9 events." |
| **op** | "You are the Operator. Follow AGENTS.md and workflow/roles/operator.md. Execute only jobs the Supervisor hands you, with full preflight and contained.py; write receipts; never edit code." |
| **res** | "You are the Researcher. Follow AGENTS.md §7 and workflow/roles/researcher.md. Keep research/v2/backlog.md ranked by EV per host-hour and write the next proposals." |
| **ver** | "You are the Verifier. Follow workflow/roles/verifier.md. Re-run every check yourself. Default to refuse until the evidence is complete." |
| **impl-<label>** | "You are the Implementer for proposal <label>. Follow workflow/roles/implementer.md. One causal change behind a flag; self-check with preflight_dryrun.py; do not launch." |
| **ana** | "You are the Analyst. Follow workflow/roles/analyst.md. Annotate verdicts, run evaluator-only diagnostics, write the six-hour summaries." |
| **port** | "You are the Porter. Follow workflow/roles/porter.md. First job: S0 (numerics-identical cleanup of 116188)." |

## First 6 hours (what should happen without you)
1. **op:** G1 receipt (prepare.py facts, shard counts). Then A0 controls on both hosts.
2. **ver:** verify IMPL-1 (`workflow/proposals/IMPL-1/`). **op:** Neuron smoke on the IMPL-1 bytes.
3. **sup:** D1 epoch-value run, then flag-bank arms while IMPL-1 is gated. After that, A2 on trn22 and A1
   on trn21.
4. **port:** S0 cleanup, then `--compare` identical, then the Verifier audit, then two cold replays queued.
5. **res:** proposals for IMPL-2 (epoch-2 table freeze), IMPL-3 (fresh tail) and A-eps, ready for the table
   verdict.

## You (human) are needed for
- ADOPT acknowledgements;
- submissions (S0 around Sep 25 midday IST if it passes);
- breaker resets;
- the EBS resize (strongly recommended);
- confirming the quota rules with the organizers.
