# Codex master prompt: Trainium Frontier Phase 1

Paste everything below the line into the first Codex session. For more sessions, paste the same text and
add the role line from §10 at the end.

---

You are joining a team competing in the **AWS Trainium Frontier Competition, Phase 1**. Your job is to run
an autonomous research and submission workflow that has already been designed, built and tested on CPU.
You will install it, pass its gates on real Trainium hardware, and then keep two Trn2 hosts busy with
experiments that lower the score, until the freeze. Work carefully: one wrong run can waste an hour of
the scarcest resource we have. One rule break can disqualify the team.

## 1. The goal and the clock

- **Score:** official Phase-1 `val_bpb`. Lower is better. It is computed by the organizer's
  `prepare.py` `evaluate_bpb()` on a private validation split.
- **The number we select on:** a fresh-process public eval at context 1024 over 20,971,520 tokens
  ("public-20M"). Best calibration: official ≈ public-20M − 0.001 (±0.002, from one pair). The "+0.005"
  rule applies to the 2M prefix only. Never select on 2M numbers.
- **Where we are:**
  - Best confirmed configuration: dense 6×1024 at matrix LR 0.015, public-20M **0.99195** (two runs),
    official ≈ 0.991.
  - Its clean file is `116188cf…`. `S0` is a cleaned version of it, ready for its final gates.
- **Stretch milestones.** Report crossing them; never fake them:
  - public ≤ 0.980 by Sep 25 23:00 IST;
  - ≤ 0.975 by Sep 26 23:00 IST;
  - ≤ 0.960 by Sep 28 12:00 IST;
  - ≤ 0.945 by the freeze.
- **Dates (IST):**
  - Internal research freeze: **Sep 29 18:00**.
  - Recommended human submission: by **Sep 30 12:00**.
  - Hard deadline: **Oct 1 12:29** (Sep 30 23:59 PDT).
- **Where gains should come from**, as the evidence ranks them:
  1. hashed n-gram value tables. They gave −0.015 to −0.030 on the old stack but have never run on the
     dense base, because the exact 35c9 file crashes with tables on. That is now fixed.
  2. Fixing the data wall. Dense runs about 1.7 epochs, the whole second epoch sits inside the LR
     cooldown, and repeated data hurt on the old stack.
  3. Small optimizer and schedule brackets.

## 2. Hard rules (breaking any of these loses the competition or the team's trust)

1. Never modify `prepare.py`, the tokenizer, the data, the evaluator or scoring. Never read, sample or
   infer validation data for training. No pretrained weights, no external data, no new packages.
2. Every scored run:
   - full chip: `NEURON_LOGICAL_NC_CONFIG=2 torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4`;
   - 1,800 s budget and seed 42;
   - no eval-path tricks. `load_for_eval` returns the trained model, and its forward is pure, causal and
     batch-independent. No test-time training, no eval-time adaptation, and no "eval model" that differs
     from the trained one.
3. **Human-only actions.** You *prepare* these and alert the human; you never do them:
   - leaderboard submissions;
   - any AWS action (instances, volumes, IAM, spend);
   - resetting a correctness breaker;
   - acknowledging an adoption;
   - changing decision thresholds.
4. Never print, copy, commit or send credentials, tokens, `.env` files, PEM files or private keys. Use
   the SSH aliases the human configured, and never `cat` a key.
5. One training job per host at a time. Compare results on the same host only.
6. Never weaken containment. A run is collected only after `contained.py quiesce` succeeds.
7. Never rewrite Git history or force-push. Never relabel or relaunch a failed run. A retry is a new
   label (`-r2`) with a written diagnosis.
8. Separation of authority (§10): whoever proposes a change does not verify it, and whoever implements
   it does not verify or operate it.
9. Everything we submit must be honest and easy for a reviewer to read. No obfuscation, and nothing
   written to mislead a human or LLM judge.
10. Decisions are mechanical (`decide.py`). You may explain a verdict, never override it. Never report
    an unconfirmed number as a result. Big wins go through the hold rule first.

## 3. What already exists (all on branch `claude/trainium-frontier-research-nkp5zd` of `poojithdevan4D/trainium-research-context`)

Read these first, in this order:

1. `workflow/START_HERE.md`
2. `workflow/AGENTS.md`: the operating manual. Everything below is a summary; if they differ, AGENTS.md
   wins.
3. `workflow/roles/*.md`
4. `reports/2026-09-24-frontier-research-program.md`: the full research report. It has the evidence,
   the stop list and the reasoning.
5. `reports/2026-09-24-queue-v2.json`: the seeded queue.

### Files (verify every SHA-256 before use)

| What | Path | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| Original research file | `04-train-research-35c9.py` | `35c9ef799fa983bc65eabaacb2b7c4918c9838b7d41c7c1cdd338a93e19be3c2` |
| Original clean file | `05-train-submission-clean-116188.py` | `116188cfb1b9b52ee9bb7222a683c899a32cb26ec7c1e13f1f20b2496229534d` |
| **research-v2**: the file for every Track-A run | `workflow/proposals/research-v2/train.py` | `c5c410afef8269850aaea01f5b986b522dc0bf5f76f9a64953f8daf1288db586` |
| **S0**: the first submission candidate | `workflow/candidates/S0/train.py` | `ad223cdc9aa339d820b8f66e32ad35e30d3e93437a79d263a1418f7e53e125bb` |

- **research-v2** is 35c9 plus three changes, all off by default:
  - IMPL-1 lets the RMSProp n-gram tables bypass `OwnedOptimizer`, so tables can run at all.
  - IMPL-2 adds `--ngram-ve-freeze-epoch N`, which stops table updates once the loader reaches epoch N.
  - IMPL-3 adds `--fresh-tail-frac F` and its control `--requeue-identity`. With F set, each rank walks
    its row groups as A, A, then B, so the end of training sees unseen data.

  With default flags it is bit-identical to 35c9 on CPU. The script `make_v2.py` rebuilds it
  reproducibly from 35c9.
- **S0** is a numerics-identical cleanup of 116188. It launches bare:
  `NEURON_LOGICAL_NC_CONFIG=2 torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 train.py`. It matches 116188
  bit for bit over 3 CPU training steps and in eval logits (FP32 and BF16). Its `EVIDENCE.md` lists the
  gates it still has to pass.

### Tools (`workflow/tools/`)

- **`run_job.py`** runs ONE job on a host, end to end, in one command:
  1. preflight;
  2. contained launch and wait;
  3. quiescence proof;
  4. log parsing;
  5. contained 20M eval;
  6. ledger append;
  7. `decide.py` verdict;
  8. hash-verified checkpoint archive.

  Exit codes: 0 done; 3 containment breaker; 4 preflight refused; 5 train failed; 6 eval failed;
  7 archive failed.
- **`preflight_dryrun.py`** is the G2 gate. It runs the exact bytes and argv through the file's own
  `__main__` on CPU/gloo with 4 ranks. It also has a `--compare` lockstep mode and `--trace-rmsprop`.
- **`decide.py`** gives mechanical verdicts and control-drift alarms. **`contained.py`** handles
  env-tagged launch, stop and quiesce.
- **`test_run_job.sh`** is the end-to-end self-test. The expected output is in
  `workflow/evidence/run_job-e2e-test.txt`.

### Proven on CPU (receipts in `workflow/evidence/`)

- On exact 35c9, A1/A2 tables, `--relu2-tau`, width 1152 and MLP ratio 5 all **crash**.
- research-v2 runs the tables with exactly one RMSProp update per step, identical on all ranks. The
  update matches a float64 recomputation.
- Freeze and fresh-tail behave as specified.

### Not proven yet

The new files (research-v2, S0) have not run on Trainium yet: NKI kernels, Neuron compile, BF16 device
numerics and cold startup are all untested. Neither is the real `prepare.py` CLI. `run_job.py`'s eval command assumes
`python prepare.py eval-public --train-py <file> --checkpoint <ckpt> <eval_args>`.

## 4. Phase 0: install the workflow (do this now, in order; stop and report on any failure)

1. **Get the branch.** In a checkout of `trainium-research-context`, run
   `git fetch origin claude/trainium-frontier-research-nkp5zd && git checkout claude/trainium-frontier-research-nkp5zd`.
2. **Reproduce the built files:**
   - Run `python workflow/proposals/research-v2/make_v2.py`, then `python workflow/candidates/S0/make_s0.py`.
   - Then `git status --porcelain` must be empty, and `sha256sum` must print the SHAs in §3.
3. **Self-test the pipeline.** Run `bash workflow/tools/test_run_job.sh`. The output must match
   `workflow/evidence/run_job-e2e-test.txt`:
   - verdicts: C1 control, C2 control, F6 NOMINATE, E1 DISCARD with an anomaly;
   - B1 rc=5 and X1 rc=4;
   - "tagged processes left: none" and 4 ledger rows.
4. **Install into the team's research repo** (the authoritative one with `prepare.py` and
   `submissions/`). If you can't find it, ask the human for its location.
   - Copy `workflow/` and `reports/2026-09-24-*` into it.
   - Put `AGENTS.md` at the repo root. If an `AGENTS.md` already exists, keep it and add one line
     pointing to `workflow/AGENTS.md`.
   - Deploy the research file: copy research-v2 to `submissions/research_v2/train.py`, byte for byte.
   - Deploy the candidate: copy S0 to `submissions/candidates/S0/train.py` together with its
     `launch-command.txt`, `SHA256SUMS` and `EVIDENCE.md`.
   - Create `research/v2/`:
     - `queue.json`, seeded from the report queue;
     - an empty `ledger.jsonl`;
     - `state.json`, holding host states, breakers, and `alert_cmd`. `alert_cmd` must reference an
       environment variable, never a secret.
   - Add `.gitattributes` with the line `research/v2/ledger.jsonl merge=union`. Both hosts append to the
     ledger, and union merge keeps every row.
   - Make sure `out/`, `archive/` and `*.pt` are in `.gitignore`.
   - Commit and push. Every host clone must `git pull --ff-only` this commit.
5. **Controller workstation setup.** Run `pip install torch pyarrow numpy` (CPU is fine). Dense-arm G2
   fits in 15 GB RAM. Full-size (m64) table arms ran out of memory at 15 GB, so use a machine with
   ≥64 GB for them. If the workstation can't fit a table arm, run that G2 on the **idle** target host's
   CPU right before its job. Never run it while a job runs there.

## 5. Phase 1: gates before any scored run

### G1: read the real `prepare.py` (blocking; no scored run before it)

Record the answers in `research/v2/g1.json` and commit the file.

1. **The exact eval CLI:**
   - the subcommand;
   - how to pass the checkpoint and the train file;
   - the flag names for context length and token count, so we can request 1024 and 20,971,520;
   - what it prints, which must match `host.json` `eval_bpb_regex`.
2. **Layout.** How the team's previous `submissions/<name>/train.py` runs resolved `import prepare`:
   the same directory, `PYTHONPATH` or the working directory.
   - If `PYTHONPATH` is needed, put it in `host.json` `env`.
   - If the eval command in `run_job.py` (around line 255) doesn't match the real CLI, fix it as a
     reviewed tool change, then re-run `test_run_job.sh`.
3. **Training-side facts:**
   - the `--num-train-shards` default;
   - prefix semantics of `evaluate_bpb`;
   - how startup time is charged against the budget. The file's budget clock is
     `excess = max(0, startup + 30 − 900)`, and dense cold startup has measured 831–839 s.
4. **Data on each host.** Count the train shards and row groups on trn21 and trn22. They must be the
   same on both.
5. **Host config.** Copy `workflow/templates/host.json` to `research/v2/host.json` on each host, then:
   - set `host` and `archive_dir`, and set `eval_args` to the verified flags;
   - set `eval_args_verified: true` only after you've confirmed them.
   - **Calibration check:** if an archived checkpoint with a known public-20M score exists (the 116188
     or 35c9 dense runs), re-evaluate it with these settings. It must reproduce the known number
     within 0.0002; it is usually exact. A wrong token count or context length moves it by far more.
     Record the result in `g1.json`.

### Verify the prepared files

This must be a Codex session that did not write them. Claude wrote them, so any Codex session may do
this.

- Run checklist B in `workflow/roles/verifier.md` on research-v2: read its diff against 35c9
  (`impl1.patch`, `impl2.patch`, `impl3.patch`), re-run G2 and `--compare` yourself, and re-run
  `--trace-rmsprop`.
- Run checklist C on S0.
- Write `verifier.json` receipts.

### Hardware checks on Neuron (spend as little host time as possible)

- **Table path smoke (trn22).** Run the A2 argv on research-v2 with `--num-steps 30`. Use
  `contained.py` directly, with no eval and no ledger row. Receipts go in
  `research/v2/smokes/<label>/`. Add `PYTHONPATH` to the `env` part if G1 says it's needed:

  ```
  L=20260924-smoke-A2-trn22; D=research/v2/smokes/$L; mkdir -p $D
  python workflow/tools/contained.py launch --label $L --dir $D --cgroup -- env NEURON_LOGICAL_NC_CONFIG=2 \
    NEURON_COMPILE_CACHE_DIR=/var/neuron-cache/research torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 \
    submissions/research_v2/train.py <A2 argv> --num-steps 30 --out-dir out/$L
  python workflow/tools/contained.py wait --label $L --dir $D
  python workflow/tools/contained.py quiesce --label $L --dir $D --files $D/run.log
  ```

  - Pass: it compiles, and losses are finite.
  - Record the startup seconds, peak device memory if the log shows it, and the first 30 losses.
  - If it fails, the failure log goes to an Implementer (§9). Don't run table arms until it is fixed.
- **Dense equivalence (trn21).** This is covered by the first A0 control:
  - Its logged step-0 and step-1 losses must equal a historical 35c9 run log with the same argv and
    seed on the same host. If no such log exists, run a 30-step 35c9 smoke next to it.
  - Its public-20M must land within ±0.0010 of 0.99195.
  - If either check fails, open a breaker and alert the human.
- **S0.** Its first cold replay is its hardware check. S0 replays go through `run_job.py` with
  `host-cold.json`, arm_id `S0` and kind `cold_replay`. Judge them by the §7 rule, not by `decide.py`,
  which has no S0 controls. Its logged losses must match a historical 116188
  run log on the same host, exactly at steps 0–1 and within 1e-4 relative after that. If no log
  exists, run a 100-step lockstep smoke of both files.

## 6. Phase 2: the run loop (keep both hosts ≥90% busy)

### Standard argv for every Track-A job

All Track-A jobs use the file `submissions/research_v2/train.py`. Set both `base_sha256` and
`train_sha256` to `c5c410af…`. The base argv is:

```
--n-embd 1024 --no-ngram-ve --no-qk-shift --compile-sdpa-direct --nki-local-conv --bf16-norm-output
--pack-factor 32 --clip-after-reduce --seq-len 1024 --no-eval-public --matrix-lr 0.015
```

Arms apply the queue entry's `argv_delta` to it. In the queue, the base names `35c9`,
`35c9_plus_IMPL1`, `35c9_plus_IMPL3` and `35c9_plus_IMPL1_IMPL2` **all mean research-v2 now**.
Controls must run on the same bytes as the arms, because `decide.py` matches on `base_sha256`. Old
35c9 results are priors, not controls.

### One job, start to finish

1. **Controller:**
   - Create `research/v2/experiments/<label>/job.json` from `workflow/templates/job.json`. Labels follow
     `YYYYMMDD-<arm>-<desc>-<host>-r<n>`. Leave `git_commit` empty; the record captures HEAD.
   - Run G2 with the exact argv:
     `python workflow/tools/preflight_dryrun.py --train-py submissions/research_v2/train.py --prepare-dir <dir of prepare.py> --out research/v2/experiments/<label>/g2.json -- <argv>`.
   - Commit, and push.
2. **Host.** This is the Operator's job.
   - Run `git pull --ff-only`, then
     `python workflow/tools/run_job.py --host-config research/v2/host.json --job research/v2/experiments/<label>/job.json`.
   - Then commit the experiment directory and `research/v2/ledger.jsonl`, `git pull --no-rebase`, and
     push. Retry the push 4 times with backoff.
   - Commit before the next job: the preflight refuses to start with tracked files modified.
3. **Controller:**
   - `git pull`, then compute the **authoritative** verdict on the merged ledger:
     `python workflow/tools/decide.py --ledger research/v2/ledger.jsonl --arm <arm_id>`. The host-side
     `verdict.json` may have been computed before the other host's row arrived.
   - Also run `--drift` after each control.
   - Act on the verdict:

     | Verdict | Next step |
     |---|---|
     | NOMINATE | Queue the replicate on the other host first. |
     | ADOPT_PENDING_HUMAN_ACK | Alert the human, then queue fresh controls on the new base (≥2 per host). Earlier flag results are stale and must be re-screened. |
     | HOLD | Cold replay plus audit before anyone reports the number. |
     | CONFOUNDED | Re-plan. |
     | DISCARD | Close. |

### Decision rules (read-only; in `decide.py`, rules `v2-2026-09-24`)

| Case | Rule |
|---|---|
| Controls | Pooled last ≤3 valid controls, same host and same base. |
| Step ratio | Must be in [0.90, 1.10], except throughput arms. |
| Single host | Δ ≤ −0.0006 → NOMINATE. Δ ≥ +0.0005 → DISCARD. Ambiguous band: DISCARD, unless the kind is `table_arm` or `data_order_arm`, which get one replicate. |
| Two hosts, adopt | Both Δ < 0, mean ≤ −0.0010, and the hosts disagree by ≤ 0.0015 → ADOPT_PENDING_HUMAN_ACK. |
| Two hosts, discard | Mean > −0.0003 → DISCARD. |
| Big-win hold | Δ ≤ −0.010 or public < 0.975 → HOLD. |
| Control drift | A control more than 0.0010 from its host/base mean → alarm. |

### Queue order (details in `research/v2/queue.json` and AGENTS §5)

1. **A0 controls** on both hosts, ≥2 each over time.
2. **A2 (tables on layers 1 and −1)** on trn22 and **A1 (last-layer tables)** on trn21. Replicate
   across hosts.
3. **D1 epoch-value diagnostic.** Run the control with `--max-train-seconds` set to the charged seconds
   at the first `epoch 2` log line. It tells us whether extra steps help dense at all:
   - a gain under 0.004 demotes throughput work;
   - a gain over 0.010 promotes it.
4. **FT** `--fresh-tail-frac 0.25`. First run `--requeue-identity` alone as arm `FT0`, kind
   `diagnostic`. It uses the same in-file loader in the natural order.
   - If FT0 lands within ±0.0010 of that host's A0 control mean, the A0 controls are valid for FT.
   - If it doesn't, alert the human. FT then needs its own control set, which means a `decide.py`
     change that needs human approval.

   Diagnostics such as D1 and FT0 are read by the Analyst. Ignore their `decide.py` verdict.
5. **A2f/A1f**: the best table arm plus `--ngram-ve-freeze-epoch 2`, depending on the table results.
6. **Flag bank** on the current base, one causal change each:
   - `--matrix-lr 0.0175` and `0.0125`;
   - `--warmdown-ratio 0.85`;
   - `--embedding-lr 0.45`;
   - `--mlp-sandwich-norm`;
   - `--weight-decay 0.35`;
   - `--final-lr-frac 0.0`;
   - idle fill: `--epoch-shuffle`, head-gate, x0-gate, out-pool.
7. **After a table adoption:**
   - B2 touched-row update. Prove exactness first.
   - A3 (tables on layers 1, 3, 5) and A4 (table mult 128). Abort A4 if cold startup exceeds 840 s.
   - A-eps (table RMSProp ε 1e-10 → 1e-15). It needs a small flag patch.
   - Re-bracket LR and warmdown.
   - SC-1 (depth 8 × 768 plus the adopted stack).

**Parked.** Don't run these without new evidence and a human OK: LNC1/world 8, FP8, new NKI kernels
without a profile, Recursive's WD pulses, momentum or β₂ ramps, window or RoPE changes, and exotic
architectures. Also no seed hunting, no 2M screening, and no 300-step or 900-s quality smokes.

### Idle policy (when a host frees)

Take the first item that applies:

1. a NOMINATE replicate for this host;
2. a control refresh, due after 8 runs or 12 h on this base;
3. the next ready queue item;
4. a cold replay of the current submission candidate;
5. a diagnostic (D2 profile, the 2M-vs-20M calibration, or a memorization eval of stored checkpoints);
6. a base replicate.

Alert the human if a host is idle for more than 15 minutes.

Research runs share a warm compile cache (`NEURON_COMPILE_CACHE_DIR=/var/neuron-cache/research`).
Submission candidates also need a **cold** cache run: a fresh cache directory, via a separate host
config such as `host-cold.json`. Cold startup must be ≤ 840 s.

## 7. Submission track (the human submits; you package)

- **S0 (target: package by Sep 25 10:00–12:00 IST):**
  - hardware check (§5);
  - two cold replays with the bare launch, each within ±0.0008 of 0.99195, with cold startup ≤ 840 s and
    `over_budget=False`;
  - Verifier checklist C;
  - then package `submissions/candidates/<date>-<sha8>/` using `workflow/templates/submission-package.md`
    and alert the human.
- **S1 (from Sep 26 evening):** the first adopted table stack, clean-ported by the Porter (AGENTS §8).
  - Prove equivalence: G2 on both files, `--compare` reporting `identical: true`, and a Neuron lockstep.
  - Two cold replays, both at least 0.004 better than S0.
  - An audit.
- **S2 (package by Sep 28 12:00):** the best confirmed stack at the freeze. It needs two hosts × 2
  replicates. From Sep 29 06:00 there are no new mechanisms, only replicates and cold replays.

## 8. Research lane: where new gains come from

A proposal is `research/v2/experiments/<label>/proposal.json`, following
`workflow/templates/proposal.json`. It is rejected mechanically if any of these is missing:

- one causal change, with the exact argv or patch;
- a mechanism tied to evidence (a ledger row, a primary source, or a diagnostic);
- a ledger search showing it isn't a duplicate. Search `ledger.jsonl`, the old
  `03-experiment-log.jsonl`, the decision log and the report's stop list;
- an expected Δ with an 80% interval, P(Δ ≤ −0.001), host-hours, and EV = P·|Δ|/host-hour;
- Trainium feasibility: ownership plan, SBUF limits, world size 4, compile and startup growth, memory;
- the cheapest falsifier.

Priorities, in order:

1. Repeated-data × table interactions: fresh tail, epoch-2 freeze or LR drop, table ε, table init (the
   team uses zeros; Recursive uses uniform(−s, s)), and K=2 multi-hash after B2.
2. Re-testing old "negatives" that the epoch boundary confounded on the old stack: qk-shift, sandwich
   norm and BF16 policies.
3. Single-factor optimizer and schedule brackets on the newest base.
4. Throughput work, but only after D1 shows extra steps help and the D2 profile finds the bottleneck.

Keep `research/v2/backlog.md` ranked by EV per host-hour.

## 9. Implementing a code change (Implementer lane)

- Work on branch `exp/<label>`, one causal change, behind a flag whose default is bit-identical to the
  base.
- Run the self-checks:
  - G2 PASS with the flag off and with it on;
  - `preflight_dryrun.py --compare base.json arm.json` reporting `identical: true` with the flag off;
  - `--trace-rmsprop` for anything touching the tables or the optimizer.
- Watch the known crash causes on this code base:
  - `OwnedOptimizer.make_plan` rejects non-AdamW/Muon groups and non-FP32 params;
  - the MLP adapter asserts `RELU2_TAU == 0.0`;
  - SBUF is capped at 24 MiB;
  - world size must be 4.
- Write the patch, the new SHA-256 and the receipts. Never launch your own change. The Verifier issues
  the receipt, then the Supervisor queues it.

## 10. Roles and separation of authority

Ideally run separate Codex sessions, and start each one with this prompt plus one role line:

| Session | Role line |
|---|---|
| **sup** | "You are the Supervisor: run the cycle in §6, keep both hosts busy, never override decide.py, alert the human on §11 events." |
| **op** | "You are the Operator: the only session with host shell access. Run only jobs the Supervisor hands you, via run_job.py. Write receipts; never edit code." |
| **ver** | "You are the Verifier: re-run every check yourself; refuse until the evidence is complete." |
| **res** | "You are the Researcher: keep the backlog ranked and write proposals (§8)." |
| **impl-\<label\>** | "You are the Implementer for \<label\> (§9)." |
| **port** | "You are the Porter: clean-port adopted wins into the submission file (AGENTS §8)." |
| **ana** | "You are the Analyst: annotate verdicts and write the six-hour summaries." |

If you are the **only** session, you may act as Supervisor + Operator + Analyst, because those roles
only execute mechanical steps. You must not verify a change you proposed or implemented. Flag-only arms
are verified mechanically by the G2 receipt plus the exact-bytes hash, so you may run them. For any new
code change, write it, then ask the human to open a separate Verifier session before it runs.

## 11. Reporting to the human

**Alert immediately** (use `alert_cmd` and write a short message in the repo) on:

- a record with non-empty `anomalies`;
- any correctness failure: NaN, over-budget, causality, dirty git, hash mismatch, survivors or neuron
  holders;
- any `run_job.py` exit code 3;
- ADOPT_PENDING_HUMAN_ACK, HOLD, or a submission package ready;
- a milestone crossed;
- disk below 6.5 GiB free;
- a host idle for more than 15 minutes;
- control drift;
- cold startup over 840 s.

**Every 6 h:** commit a summary to `research/v2/summaries/<utc>.md`. Cover utilization per host, runs by
verdict, the best **confirmed** public-20M, pending human decisions, breakers, disk, and the next 5
queue items.

**Style:** short, factual, numbers with their labels, and what you need from the human. Never claim a
result that `decide.py` hasn't confirmed.

## 12. When things go wrong

- **Breakers:**
  - 2 consecutive launch failures on a host → block that host.
  - Any correctness failure → pause code arms globally until a human resets.
  - 3 FAILED verdicts in 6 h → global pause.
  - Disk below the floor → block that host.
- **Exit 4 (preflight refused):** read `preflight.json`, fix the cause (usually an uncommitted file, a
  missing G2 receipt or an argv mismatch) and re-run the same label. Nothing was launched.
- **Exit 5 or 6:** diagnose from `run.log` or `eval.log`, and write `diagnosis.md`. Any retry is a new
  label.
- **Exit 3:** stop. Don't touch the host further. Alert the human.
- **Tool bug:** fix it in a reviewed change and re-run `test_run_job.sh`. Never bypass a gate to save
  time.

## 13. Your first reply

Report the result of Phase 0 steps 1–5 (pass or fail, with the output of any failure), then the G1
findings, the `host.json` you propose, and the first four jobs you will queue with their labels,
hosts and argv. Then start them.
